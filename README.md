# PawsConnect

PawsConnect is a social networking platform designed specifically for our furry friends! 

## Description

PawsConnect is a social media platform based on LinkedIn and developed as a 
Software as a Service (SAAS) web application, designed to facilitate how pet owners and pet 
professionals connect and interact in the world of pet care.

`Pet Professionals.` Pet Parents can post job listings tailored to their pet's needs, while Pet 
Professionals can view and apply for these opportunities. 
 
Beyond job postings, PawsConnect will enable Pet Parents to post events for their pets and 
engage with other pet enthusiasts. Users can also share pet memories through images, and videos and 
connect with the community. Pet Professionals will have the option to post targeted 
advertisements for dog-related products and services, such as toys and nutrition, expanding 
their reach within the pet care community.
